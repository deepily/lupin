# Claude Code's REST API and macOS audio notification capabilities

Claude Code, Anthropic's terminal-based AI coding assistant, offers robust capabilities for both REST API interactions and system-level integration on macOS, though implementation requires understanding its security model and available workarounds.

## REST API capabilities require language-specific implementations

Claude Code **lacks built-in HTTP client functionality** due to security restrictions that block direct `curl` and `wget` commands. However, it can effectively make REST API calls, including PUT requests to localhost, through several proven methods:

**Python requests library** serves as the primary method for HTTP operations. Claude Code can execute Python scripts that leverage the requests library for comprehensive API interactions:

```python
import requests

# PUT request to localhost API
url = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/endpoint"
data = {"key": "value"}
headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}

response = requests.put(url, json=data, headers=headers)
print(f"Status: {response.status_code}")
print(f"Response: {response.json()}")
```

For more robust implementations, Claude Code can create **API client classes** with error handling and retry logic:

```python
import requests
import time
from typing import Dict, Any, Optional

class LocalAPIClient:
    def __init__(self, base_url, api_key=None):
        self.base_url = base_url
        self.headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
        if api_key:
            self.headers["Authorization"] = f"Bearer {api_key}"
    
    def put_resource(self, endpoint, data, max_retries=3):
        url = f"{self.base_url}/{endpoint.lstrip('/')}"
        
        for attempt in range(max_retries):
            try:
                response = requests.put(url, json=data, headers=self.headers)
                if response.status_code < 500:  # Don't retry client errors
                    return {
                        "success": response.status_code < 400,
                        "status_code": response.status_code,
                        "data": response.json() if response.content else None
                    }
            except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
                if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                    return {"success": False, "error": str(e)}
                time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff

# Usage example
client = LocalAPIClient("http://localhost:5000", "your-api-key")
result = client.put_resource("/api/users/456", {"name": "John Doe"})
```

## macOS audio notifications work through native system commands

Claude Code excels at system integration on macOS, with **full access to native audio notification commands** through its bash tool. The system requires explicit permissions for command execution, but once granted, provides comprehensive notification capabilities:

**Text-to-speech notifications** using the `say` command offer immediate audio feedback:

```bash
# Basic completion notification
say "Build complete!"

# With specific voice and conditional logic
if npm run build; then
    say -v "Samantha" "Build succeeded - all tests passed"
else
    say -v "Alex" "Build failed - please check the output"
fi
```

**System sounds and custom audio** enhance the notification experience:

```bash
# Play system sounds
afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff

# Custom notification workflow
npm test
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    afplay ~/sounds/success.wav
    osascript -e 'display notification "All tests passed" with title "Success" sound name "Glass"'
else
    afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Basso.aiff
    osascript -e 'display notification "Tests failed" with title "Error"'
fi
```

## Security model balances power with protection

Claude Code implements a **permission-based security architecture** that affects both API calls and system commands. Key restrictions include:

**Network limitations** block direct curl/wget commands by default, even for localhost. This security measure requires using programming language libraries (Python requests, Node.js fetch) instead of shell commands for HTTP operations. An open feature request exists to allow curl for `.localhost` domains while maintaining external restrictions.

**Folder boundary enforcement** restricts Claude Code to the directory where it was started and its subdirectories. This prevents unauthorized access to parent directories or system files, creating a natural security boundary for project work.

**Command execution controls** require explicit approval for potentially dangerous operations. System commands like `say`, `afplay`, and `osascript` need initial permission but can be allowlisted for repeated use within a session.

## Model Context Protocol enables advanced integrations

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** provides a pathway for enhanced functionality. MCP servers can extend Claude Code's capabilities for both HTTP operations and system notifications:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "http-client": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/http-mcp-server.js"]
    },
    "notification-server": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["path/to/notification-server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

Third-party solutions like **AgentAPI** create HTTP endpoints for controlling Claude Code programmatically:

```bash
# Start AgentAPI server
agentapi server -- claude --allowedTools "Bash(git*) Edit Replace"

# Control via REST API
curl -X POST localhost:3284/message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "Make a PUT request to localhost:8000/api/users", "type": "user"}'
```

## Best practices for production implementations

**Containerization** provides the most secure deployment option. Docker containers isolate Claude Code while allowing controlled access to local APIs and system resources. The `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag should only be used within containerized environments, never on production systems.

**Permission management** through `.claude/settings.json` enables persistent configurations:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allowedTools": ["Bash", "FileRead", "FileEdit"],
    "allowedDomains": ["localhost", "127.0.0.1"],
    "autoApprove": ["say", "afplay", "osascript"]
  }
}
```

**Notification workflows** benefit from creating reusable functions in shell profiles:

```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
notify_task_complete() {
    local task=$1
    local status=$2
    
    if [ "$status" = "success" ]; then
        say "$task completed successfully"
        osascript -e "display notification \"$task finished\" with title \"Success\""
    else
        say "$task failed"
        osascript -e "display notification \"$task failed\" with title \"Error\" sound name \"Basso\""
    fi
}

# Usage in Claude Code workflows
npm run build && notify_task_complete "Build" "success" || notify_task_complete "Build" "failure"
```

## Practical implementation patterns emerge from community usage

**Development workflow integration** commonly combines API calls with notifications:

```python
import requests
import subprocess
import json

def deploy_with_notifications(api_endpoint, deployment_data):
    """Deploy to local API with audio feedback"""
    
    # Start deployment
    subprocess.run(["say", "Starting deployment"])
    
    try:
        # Make PUT request to deployment API
        response = requests.put(
            f"http://localhost:8080{api_endpoint}",
            json=deployment_data,
            headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"},
            timeout=30
        )
        
        if response.status_code == 200:
            subprocess.run(["say", "Deployment successful"])
            subprocess.run(["afplay", "/System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff"])
            return {"success": True, "data": response.json()}
        else:
            subprocess.run(["say", f"Deployment failed with status {response.status_code}"])
            subprocess.run(["afplay", "/System/Library/Sounds/Basso.aiff"])
            return {"success": False, "error": f"Status {response.status_code}"}
            
    except Exception as e:
        subprocess.run(["say", "Deployment error occurred"])
        return {"success": False, "error": str(e)}
```

**Progressive notification systems** provide feedback during long-running operations:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# progress_build.sh - Build with progress notifications

echo "Starting build process..."
say "Build initiated"

# Run build steps with notifications
steps=("Installing dependencies" "Running tests" "Building application" "Optimizing assets")
commands=("npm install" "npm test" "npm run build" "npm run optimize")

for i in ${!steps[@]}; do
    echo "Step $((i+1)): ${steps[$i]}"
    say "${steps[$i]}"
    
    if ${commands[$i]}; then
        afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Pop.aiff
    else
        say "Step failed: ${steps[$i]}"
        afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Basso.aiff
        exit 1
    fi
done

say "Build completed successfully"
osascript -e 'display notification "All build steps completed" with title "Build Success" sound name "Glass"'
```

## Conclusion

Claude Code provides powerful capabilities for both REST API interactions and macOS system notifications, though implementation requires working within its security constraints. The combination of Python/Node.js for HTTP operations and native macOS commands for audio feedback creates an effective development environment. Success depends on understanding the permission model, leveraging appropriate workarounds for network restrictions, and implementing robust error handling for production use cases.

The tool's architecture prioritizes security while maintaining flexibility through MCP extensions and language-specific implementations. For teams requiring REST API integration with audio feedback on macOS, Claude Code offers a viable solution when properly configured and deployed within its security framework.
