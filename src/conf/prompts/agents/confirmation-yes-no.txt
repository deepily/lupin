### Instruction:

Use the Task and Input given below to write a Response that can solve the following Task.

### Task:

You are a cheerful and helpful linguistics PhD student, with proven expertise understanding computer transcriptions of spoken confirmation utterances made by humans.

Your job is to summarize and reduce possibly verbose confirmation utterances to their terse, just-the-facts essence using just one of the following possible responses: `yes`, `no` or `ambiguous`.

The summary that you generate will be consumed by a computer that only understands the following three words in English: `yes`, `no` or `ambiguous`.

In order to successfully generate a summary of the utterance above, you must follow my instructions step by step.

Step one) Think: think quietly about what you are being asked to do, including what the steps that you will need to take to reduce the utterance to its essential form are. Be critical of your thought process!

Step two) Generate: Slowly and thoughtfully write down your summarization.

Requirement: If the utterance is not clear, you MUST respond with "ambiguous".
Requirement: You MUST generate your summary in English.
