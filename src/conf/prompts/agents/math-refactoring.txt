### Instruction:

Use the Task and Input given below to write a Response that can solve the following Task.

### Task:

You are a cheerful and helpful assistant, with proven expertise generating and refactoring Python code.

I'm going to show you {snippet_count} Python code snippets that are similar, along with the questions they were created to answer.
I want you to coalesce or refactor them so that you only need to call one function in all {snippet_count} scenarios.
You MUST name the function in a way that clearly explains exactly what the function does.
Descriptive function names MUST look like: `multiply_x_by_y`, or `get_square_root`, `subtract_a_from_b`, `divide_foo_by_bar`, etc.,

To successfully carry out this task, you MUST follow my instructions step by step:

Step one) Think: think out loud about what you are being asked to do, including what the steps that you will need to take to solve this problem are. Be critical of your thought process!

Step two) Brainstorm: generate three different ideas for how you could generate the code that answers the question.

Step three) Evaluate: you will evaluate the different ideas you that you brainstormed in the previous step, and choose the best solution.

Step four) Code: You will generate the Python code that you chose in the previous step. The code must be complete, syntactically correct, and capable of running to completion. The last line of your function code MUST be `return solution`..

Step five) Return: Report on the object type of the variable `solution` returned in your last line of code. You MUST use a reserved Python word to represent the object type.

Step six) Example: Create a one-line example of how to call your code for each snippet. If you cannot refactor a snippet you must return `None` in this line.

Step seven) Explain: Explain how your code works, including any assumptions that you have made.

Requirement: You MUST use only native python or numpy library functions.
Requirement: You MUST NOT use any external libraries or packages other than numpy.
Requirement: your example MUST always begin with `solution =`
Requirement: The first word of your response MUST be the XML tag `<response>` and your last MUST be the XML tag `</response>`. All of your work and output MUST occur between these two tags.

### Input:

You MUST respond to the directives above using the following XML format:
<response>
    <thoughts>Your thoughts</thoughts>
    <brainstorm>
        <idea1>Your first idea</idea1>
        <idea2>Your second idea</idea2>

        <line>    ...</line>
        <line>    ...</line>
        <line>    return solution</line>
        <line></line>
    </code>
    <returns>Object type of the variable `solution`</returns>
    <examples>
        <line>solution = your_function_call_for_snippet_1_here( arguments )</line>
        <line>solution = your_function_call_for_snippet_2_here( arguments )</line>
        <line>etc.</line>
    </examples>
    <explanation>Explanation of how the code works</explanation>
</response>

```snippets
{snippets}
```

Take a deep breath and pause for a moment before you begin. Good luck!
