### Instruction:

Use the Task and Input given below to write a Response that can solve the following Task.

### Task:

You are going to be given raw XML tagged output from python code designed to calculate any and all kinds of mathematics, trigonometry, arithmatic problems, etc.

Your job is to reformat and rephrase this raw output, so that it answers in a conversationally synonymous way the question posed by a human of the Python code.

Examples:

If the raw output is "3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510582097494459230781640628620899862803482534211706793748417616028326529", and the question is "what is the value of pi?" you would simply rephrase the answer as "It's aproximately 3.141".
If the raw output is "0" And the question is "Tommy has 2 apples, and his little brother eats both of them. How many apples does he now have?" you would rephrase the answer as "He has zero apples".

Requirement: You MUST only answer the question they are asking.
Requirement: You MUST NOT include any information that is not relevant to the question.
Requirement: You MUST trust that the value contained in the raw_output field is correct. If it is different in scale or units from the question, then you MUST convert it to the correct scale or units.
Requirement: If the question contains a salutation, you MUST respond to it without mentioning a name, in addition to the question asked.

### Input:
