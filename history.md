# Lupin Session History

## 2025.07.11 - WebSocket User Routing Architecture Design

### Summary
Investigated FastAPI migration status and analyzed the `/api/push` endpoint's end-to-end flow. Identified critical architectural issue where WebSocket IDs (ephemeral) are used instead of user IDs (persistent) for event routing. Created comprehensive design document for user-centric event routing system with multi-session support and future offline event queuing.

### Work Performed

1. **FastAPI Migration Status Analysis**:
   - Confirmed complete migration from Flask to FastAPI (completed June 28, 2025)
   - Verified `/api/push` endpoint functionality with producer-consumer queue pattern
   - Analyzed WebSocketManager capabilities and existing event emission infrastructure
   - Documented comprehensive event types currently supported

2. **Critical Issue Identification**:
   - Found that `websocket_id` parameter in `/api/push` gets lost during job processing
   - Identified fundamental problem: WebSocket IDs are ephemeral (browser refresh, network issues, multiple tabs)
   - Determined that agents cannot emit user-specific events, causing all responses to broadcast
   - Analyzed serialization concerns with ephemeral data in persistent snapshots

3. **Architectural Design Development**:
   - Designed user-centric event routing replacing websocket_id with user_id
   - Leveraged existing WebSocketManager user-to-session mapping infrastructure
   - Planned multi-session support for users with multiple tabs/devices
   - Designed resilient system handling disconnections and reconnections

4. **Implementation Planning**:
   - Created 3-phase implementation strategy (15h + 20h + 44h effort estimates)
   - Phase 1: User-based routing (immediate, low risk)
   - Phase 2: Enhanced event types (near-term, medium risk)
   - Phase 3: Persistent event queue (future, high risk - stubbed)

5. **Technical Specifications**:
   - Defined serialization exclusion requirements for ephemeral data
   - Documented event flow architecture and message formats
   - Planned edge cases handling (offline users, multiple sessions, security)
   - Created comprehensive tracking matrix with dependencies and risks

### Files Created
- `/src/rnd/2025.07.11-websocket-user-routing-architecture.md` - Comprehensive design document with 3-phase implementation plan

### Files Modified
- `/src/rnd/README.md` - Added link to new architecture document

### Key Insights

**WebSocket Infrastructure Status**: 
- WebSocketManager already supports user-based routing via `emit_to_user()` and session mapping
- FIFO queues have full access to WebSocketManager for rich event emission
- Current event types: queue updates, audio streaming, job notifications, system events

**Architectural Principle Established**:
- Store persistent user_id with jobs, never ephemeral websocket_id
- Resolve current sessions dynamically at emission time
- Support multiple concurrent sessions per user
- Plan for offline event persistence (stubbed for future implementation)

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Immediate: Fix user_id propagation through job processing chain (~15 hours)
- Near-term: Enhance event taxonomy for richer user experience (~20 hours)
- Future: Add persistent event queue for offline users (~44 hours, stubbed)

### Current Status
- **FastAPI Migration**: ✅ Complete - Flask eliminated, all endpoints functional
- **Queue Processing**: ✅ Working with producer-consumer pattern (6700x performance improvement)
- **WebSocket Events**: ✅ Infrastructure ready, needs user-centric routing
- **Architecture Design**: ✅ Complete with phased implementation plan
- **Ready for Phase 1**: User-based routing implementation

### Next Session Priority
Begin Phase 1 implementation: Add user_id propagation to job processing chain and update event emission to use user-based routing.

   - Updated all import statements in dependent files
4. **Renamed shell scripts**:
   - `run-genie-gui.sh` → `run-lupin-gui.sh`
   - `run-genie-gui.command` → `run-lupin-gui.command`
   - Updated script contents and references
5. **Updated configuration files**:
   - Changed display names in `gib-app.ini` from "Genie in the Box" to "Lupin"
6. **Created R&D documentation index** - `src/rnd/README.md` with comprehensive overview
7. **Testing and validation**:
   - Verified Python syntax on all renamed files
   - Tested import paths and dependencies
   - Confirmed script executability

### Technical Details
- All file renames maintain compatibility with existing infrastructure
- Directory structure preserved (genie-in-the-box directory name unchanged)
- Firefox plugin references left untouched as requested
- External URLs and dependencies remain functional
- Progress notifications sent throughout the process

### Files Renamed
- Client files: 3 Python files renamed with import updates
- Shell scripts: 2 script files renamed and updated
- No directory structure changes (as requested)

### Current Status
Project successfully rebranded to "Lupin". All functionality preserved, documentation updated, and comprehensive planning documents created for future reference.

### Next Steps
- Monitor for any issues with renamed files
- Update any external references if needed
- Continue development under the new "Lupin" branding

## 2025.06.28 - Flask Infrastructure Elimination

### Summary
Successfully completed the removal of deprecated Flask server infrastructure from the Lupin project. This eliminates ~1000+ lines of deprecated code and simplifies the architecture to use only FastAPI.

### Work Performed
1. **Created backup branch** `backup-flask-removal-2025-06-28` for safety
2. **Verified FastAPI coverage** - Confirmed that FastAPI has equivalent endpoints for all critical Flask functionality
   - Identified 4 missing endpoints (get-gists, get-io-stats, get-all-io, load-stt-model) that appear to be non-critical
3. **Deleted Flask infrastructure**:
   - Removed `src/app.py` (508 lines)
   - Removed `src/scripts/run-flask-gib.sh`
   - Removed `src/scripts/run-flask-tts.sh`
4. **Updated client references**:
   - Changed `write_method` parameter from "flask" to "api" in `lupin_client.py` (formerly genie_client.py)
   - Changed `write_method` parameter from "flask" to "api" in `lupin_client_gui.py` (formerly genie_client_gui.py)
   - Updated comment from "flask server" to "API server"
5. **Archived migration documents**:
   - Moved `2025.04.05-flask-to-fastapi-migration.md` to `src/rnd/archived/`
   - Moved `2025.05.19-flask-to-fastapi-migration-plan.md` to `src/rnd/archived/`
6. **Updated documentation**:
   - Updated CLAUDE.md to remove Flask references
   - Changed Flask server command to FastAPI server command
   - Updated project structure section to reflect FastAPI-only architecture

### Technical Details
- FastAPI server continues to run on port 7999 (same as Flask)
- All client code now uses generic "api" terminology instead of Flask-specific terms
- No broken imports or references were found after Flask removal

### Next Steps
- Monitor for any issues with the 4 missing endpoints
- Consider implementing the missing endpoints in FastAPI if they're needed
- Update any remaining documentation that might reference Flask

### Current Status
The Flask elimination is complete. The project now runs entirely on FastAPI, simplifying maintenance and improving consistency.
