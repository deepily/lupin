## 2025.06.28 - Flask Infrastructure Elimination

### Summary
Successfully completed the removal of deprecated Flask server infrastructure from the Genie-in-the-Box project. This eliminates ~1000+ lines of deprecated code and simplifies the architecture to use only FastAPI.

### Work Performed
1. **Created backup branch** `backup-flask-removal-2025-06-28` for safety
2. **Verified FastAPI coverage** - Confirmed that FastAPI has equivalent endpoints for all critical Flask functionality
   - Identified 4 missing endpoints (get-gists, get-io-stats, get-all-io, load-stt-model) that appear to be non-critical
3. **Deleted Flask infrastructure**:
   - Removed `src/app.py` (508 lines)
   - Removed `src/scripts/run-flask-gib.sh`
   - Removed `src/scripts/run-flask-tts.sh`
4. **Updated client references**:
   - Changed `write_method` parameter from "flask" to "api" in `genie_client.py`
   - Changed `write_method` parameter from "flask" to "api" in `genie_client_gui.py`
   - Updated comment from "flask server" to "API server"
5. **Archived migration documents**:
   - Moved `2025.04.05-flask-to-fastapi-migration.md` to `src/rnd/archived/`
   - Moved `2025.05.19-flask-to-fastapi-migration-plan.md` to `src/rnd/archived/`
6. **Updated documentation**:
   - Updated CLAUDE.md to remove Flask references
   - Changed Flask server command to FastAPI server command
   - Updated project structure section to reflect FastAPI-only architecture

### Technical Details
- FastAPI server continues to run on port 7999 (same as Flask)
- All client code now uses generic "api" terminology instead of Flask-specific terms
- No broken imports or references were found after Flask removal

### Next Steps
- Monitor for any issues with the 4 missing endpoints
- Consider implementing the missing endpoints in FastAPI if they're needed
- Update any remaining documentation that might reference Flask

### Current Status
The Flask elimination is complete. The project now runs entirely on FastAPI, simplifying maintenance and improving consistency.
